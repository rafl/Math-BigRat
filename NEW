Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!

Whats new in this version:

 * bfac() now works for integers (x/1), and returns $x->bnan() instead of
   Math::BigRat->bnan() (modify in-place)
 * bpow() faster for x/1 ** y/1 and x/z ** y/1 cases (some of the speedups are
   two-digit factors :)
 * bpow() no longer litters stdout
 * removed some (all of them commented out) debug prints to reduce footprint
 * shortened testfile bigrat.t
 * some hardcoded 'Math::BigInt' replaced with '$MBI'
 * bceil() would leave -0 in some cases
 * (more) tests: bceil/bfloor/bpow/bfac/parts/denominator/nominator/binc/bdec
 * parts('-3/1') would return (3,1) instead of (-3,1)
 * parts() did not work for NaN, +inf, -inf
 * numerator()/denominator() did not work for inf,-inf,NaN
 * new('1.2.2') was valid (resulted in 12/10 due to bug in BigFloat)
 * new() for some cases left internal state not as 0/0 for NaN, inf, -inf etc
 * binc()/bdec() were missing entirely

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
