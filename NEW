Whats new in this version:
 * fixed bstr()/bsstr() for negative output and inf/NaN
 * _d/_n were accidentily swapped
 * added numerator()/denominator()/parts() and doc and tests
 * fixed is_one()
 # '1/ ' is as invalid as '1/'
 * badd/bsub/bmul: inf/NaN handling was wrong due to copy&paste (ha!) from bdiv
 * more extensive testsuite (about 400 tests)
 * bnorm() normalizes 0/x to 0/1
 * badd()/bsub()/bmul()/bdiv() handle +/-/NaN/inf/-inf sign properly
 * t/Math/BigRat/Test.pm: fixed bstr() and bsstr() to handle inf/NaN and signs

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
