What's new in Math::BigRat v0.12:
 * fixed bug in is_one() (segfault under v.5.6.x)
 * implemented length() and digit() for integers
 * added AUTOLOAD to load fxxx() stubs (for BigFloat compatibility tests)
 * $IMPORT for require and AUTOLOAD
 * added as_bin(), as_hex() which work for integers, NaN, and +-inf
 * implement broot() and blog() for non-integer numbers
 * fixed blsft()/brsft() to work with undefined or scalar base
 * added a copy() method to be independend from BigInt's copy()
 * adopted to new internal format of Math::BigFloat v1.44 (from BigInt v1.70)

Please have an arbitrarily big rat.
