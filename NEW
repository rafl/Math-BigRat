Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!

What's new in v0.10:

 * fixed a bug in new() that failed with
    Math::BigRat->new(Math::BigInt::Lite->new(123));
 * fixed new() to work better under
    use Math::BigRat with => 'Math::BigInt::Lite';
 * add a test for "require Math::BigRat; $x = Math::BigRat->new(123); $x++;"
   (it already works since we "use Math::BigFloat;"
 * as_number() forgot to disable $upgrade, so the result was a BigRat again
   when run under -Mbigrat. Thanx to Ian Phillips.
 * require Carp; Carp::croak () instead of simple die()
 * implemented bmod() - Thanx Ian Phillips.
 * bsqrt() now returns a big rationale
 * tests for bmod(), as_number(), bsqrt() and some NaN cases
 * numify() is now much faster (38400 vs 720 tries/s on 2 Ghz AMD XP 2400+)
 * implement trapping of creation of NaN/inf/-inf
 * fix bsqrt(3/4) and similiar cases

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
