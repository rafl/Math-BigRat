What's new in Math::BigRat v0.11:

 * require Exporter vs. use it
 * more tests for bacmp(), bnorm()
 * fixed bug in bacmp() with ($x,[+-]inf)
 * fixed bug in new("+-inf/X") (e.g. "-inf/5" resulted in "inf", not "-inf")
 * delete _a and _p on _d and _n, reduces size of a BigRat object from
   887 bytes to 767 bytes on a x86 32 bit system. This also makes some
   operations slightly (single-digit percentages) faster.
 * bacmp() is about 20% faster
 * bcmp() is:
   * about 4 times faster if sign($x) != sign($y)
   * about 20% faster if sign($x) == sign($y)
 * added broot(), bmodinv(), bmodpow(), blog() so that their equivalent of:
    # perl -MMath::BigRat=:constant -le '$a = 2.0 ** 32; print $a->broot(4)'
     Can't call method "copy" on an undefined value at BigFloat.pm line 1442.
   works now for integer arguments and inf/NaN, at least.
 * doc: rationales => rational numbers

Please have an arbitrarily big rat.
