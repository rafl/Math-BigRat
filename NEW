Whats new in this version:
 * ripped out doc and replaced by something closer to the truth
 * subclass of BigFloat w/ overload section
 * uses d/n instead of x/y for denominator and nominator
 * tests from Math::BigFloat with a test subclass warping the input/output
 * added preliminary bmul(), badd(), bdiv() methods
 * added binf(), bone(), bzero() and bnan()
 * added _bzero(), _bone(), _bnan() and _binf() (bnan() etc inherited)
 * dummy blog(), bceil(), floor(), bfac() and bpow() functions
 * parse input as '0.1', '0.1/0.1', '1/10', '10' or '10/0.1'
 * input as Math::BigInts or Math::BigFloats is okay

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
