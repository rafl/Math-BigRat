Whats new in this version:

* bcmp/bacmp/as_number/bfloor/bceil work now
* bsqrt() is better now
* t/Math/BigInt/Test.pm is fixed now and makes a much better figure
  (formerly almost all of the 1500 tests in bigfltrt.inc would fail. Now we
  fail "only" 868 of 2014 tests, and most of them since the test dies early.
* added stubs for round, bfround, bround and certain others

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
