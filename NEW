Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!

What's new in this version:

 * fixed bug in bsstr() which always returned positive sign
 * added a numify method so that $array[Math::BigRat->new('17/8')] works now

Please have arbitrarily big amounts of fun.
