* rounding needs a new definiton: rounding to nearest fraction (see Knuth
  and fixed-slash fractions)
* bmod(), bmodpow(), bmodinv(), broot() not fully/properly implemented yet
* bsqrt() is also not quite optimal yet

Quite some stuff needs still to be done.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
